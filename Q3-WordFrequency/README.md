# Python Q3: Word Frequency Counter

## Objective
Read a text file and count word frequencies, displaying the top 3 most common words.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `count_word_frequency(filename)` that:
- Reads text from a file
- Counts frequency of each word (case-insensitive)
- Returns total word count and top 3 most frequent words

## Example
**Input File (text.txt):** `Python code python data`  
**Expected Output:**
```
Total Words: 4
Top 3:
python - 2
code - 1
data - 1
```

## Instructions
1. Complete the `count_word_frequency()` function in `main.py`
2. The function should:
   - Read from the file `text.txt`
   - Count words (case-insensitive)
   - Return a dictionary with:
     - `'total'`: Total number of words
     - `'top_3'`: List of tuples [(word, count), ...]
3. Click "Run Code" to test your implementation
4. Click "Run Tests" to validate against all test cases

## Challenges
- Read and process text file
- Count word frequencies (case-insensitive)
- Return top 3 most frequent words
